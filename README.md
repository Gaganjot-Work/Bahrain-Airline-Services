BAS Team wanted to streamline the tracking of project requests and associated tasks, they sought a solution that would also provide quick insights into issues and risks for each project. To eliminate manual processes, we designed a comprehensive dashboard offering three distinct views—Organizational, Tasks Overview, and Portfolio View—delivering multi-layered insights tailored to different organizational levels.

Leveraging my expertise in Power BI, I developed and maintained these dashboards, integrating data from OData feeds, SharePoint, and SQL. This ensured real-time, actionable intelligence. My focus on data visualization and the creation of key performance indicators (KPIs) empowered stakeholders to make confident, data-driven decisions.
